In this Git Repo, a number of example projects and code fragments are shown as examples of my work. 
Here are short descriptions of the works:
- **jacobi** This is a set of examples written in Fortran that are used in an serial optimization workshop that I have developed. 
- **monopoly** This is a Python-project to simulate Monopoly to determine the probabilities of landing on certain squares to study strategies for playing Monopoly. 
- **monteCarloMin** This is a Monte Carlo Minimization of the energy of an electronic system.
